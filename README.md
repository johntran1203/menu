# Project Overview

## Simple Com Tam



## Project Description

When going to an authentic vietnamese restaurant it could confusing and stressful experience.  As soon as you sit down the waiter gives you a menu and ask what you want right away. The menu is in vietnamese with a little bit of english.  There's no picture of what you want to order.  My idea is an App Where the user can pick there food like chiptole style.  No need to deal with a server and there will be pictures of what you want to order. Chipotle the restaurant help me come up with the idea.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "rec2WbmKsAelwTnNF",
            "fields": {
                "side": "beef broth",
                "drink": "beer",
                "rice": "jasmine white",
                "protein": "grilled pork paste",
                "Name": "tony"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-09-20T18:22:26.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recUsWi3GYa3CaZJD",
            "fields": {
                "side": "rice paper and lettuce",
                "drink": "water",
                "rice": "chicken rice",
                "protein": "charbroiled meatball",
                "Name": "fern"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-09-20T18:22:26.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recnHbNjYLnSwp4y0",
            "fields": {
                "side": "carrot and daikon",
                "drink": "coke",
                "rice": "brown rice",
                "protein": "grilled beef",
                "Name": "jim"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-09-20T18:22:26.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recnHbNjYLnSwp4y0"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api for food 
- display the food so the user can select what food option they want
- edit or delete the food selction
- display your order and submit your order
- pay your order with venmo (My QR code Lol)

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add another API to maybe display the calories
- have a save button of user old order
- maybe a location API of where the restaurant is


## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
    I have a good unerstanding with React and what I want to buld this week.  I think I know where to start.  I think the wireframe will guide me on building on this project.
### Weaknesses:
    I am debating if I want to used everything I learn for this project.  I don't have a great understanding on class components as function components. We don't have to used class extend components but I want to get better at react so I might attempt to apply it. 
### Opportunities:
    I have an opportunity to work with Airtable API and create my own API.  this will give me a better opportunity to have a better understadning with API.  I also be able to build my own project with react and hopefully it will be done in time and I am able to present it on project day.
### Threats:
I am afraid that I will not have enough time to implement everything I want.  I also hope I don't overthink my project and try to do to much.  To solve this problem my plan is to have the basic of my app up and running before I try to do to much.
