            <p>When going to an authentic vietnamese restaurant it could confusing and stressful experience. As soon as you sit down the waiter gives you a menu and ask what you want right away. The menu is in vietnamese with a little bit of english. There's no picture of what you want to order. Wiht our user can pick there food like chiptole style. No need to deal with a server and there will be pictures of what you want to order. </p>
